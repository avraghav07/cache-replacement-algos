# Cache Replacement Algorithms 

This repo contains 2 C++ files, which can be executed using the g++ compiler, that try to do their best to showcase the Least Recently Used and Least Frequently Used cache replacement algorithms. 

The main purpose of the repo is to try and compare the efficiency of the two algorithms, by contrasting the number of cache misses for a given set of data to each of the algorithms.

The presentation explains our findings and tries to explain some other practically useful data that we came across.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Compile the files, execute them and then follow the in-line instructions. Enter positive integers for all the input calls.

- 'Cache size' determines the size of the cache, **'Main memory size' determines the number of distinct pages in your memory sequence** (we will see why this is important in the presentation) and 'Length of the memory sequence' determines the size of the chain of page requests.

- The final contents of the cache along with the number of Cache Misses are printed out.

- Comments do a decent enough job to explain most of the code (is what I felt).
